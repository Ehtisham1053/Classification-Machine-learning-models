The classification algorithms in this repository are designed to solve a wide range of categorical data problems, providing powerful tools for tasks such as binary and multi-class classification. The models included, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks (MLP), are implemented with detailed code examples and practical use cases. These models can be applied to real-world scenarios like spam detection, image classification, and medical diagnosis, offering flexibility in handling both small and large datasets. Comprehensive documentation and performance evaluation metrics are provided for each algorithm to facilitate ease of understanding and application.
